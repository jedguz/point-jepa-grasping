It’s Friday Morning! We are on Dino’s Cafe! I’ve got a sunshine chicken curry! It’s gonna be the hottest day of the year and I can’t wait for a pint later today! But first I’m gonna go out in my van and I’m not going home until I’m proud. Rember tough times don’t last but tough people do. Keep on going and don’t give up. Have a wonderful Friday. Not long till we park up then vans and lock us those warehouses and get to the pub cheers to you all. Bosh❤️🇬🇧🍺
