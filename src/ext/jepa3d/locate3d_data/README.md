# Locate 3D Dataset
![A comparison of Locate 3D Dataset with other datasets](figure.png)

### What is the dataset?
Locate 3D Dataset (L3DD) is a new human-annotated referring expression dataset, much like [ScanRefer](https://daveredrum.github.io/ScanRefer/) or [NR3D](https://referit3d.github.io/). It contains 131,641 samples and covers ScanNet (v2), ScanNet++ (v1), and ARKitScenes. L3DD is the first 3D RefExp dataset to cover multiple scene datasets and is by far the largest human-annotated 3D RefExp dataset.

When added to ScanRefer, SR3D, and NR3D, this data yielded around a 2% performance increase to model performance on existing benchmarks. Further, because our evaluation set spans multiple scene datasets, it can be used to accurately gauge the scene generalization capabilities of a 3D language grounding model.

### How is the dataset structured?
We closely mirror the structure of [ScanEnts3D-NR3D](https://scanents3d.github.io/). The dataloader we share also accepts a ScanEnts3D-NR3D JSON as input. We share a single JSON for each pair of scene dataset and split. For example, one JSON may contain all of the data for ScanNet on validation scenes. Each JSON is a list of samples where each sample looks like the example below.

- **object_id** is the object ID in the underlying scene dataset's instance segmentation data.
- **object_name** is the name of the target object.
- **ann_id** is an incrementing ID for the annotation within the scene. For example, if ScanNet scene0000_00 had two annotations, they would have **ann_id**s 0 and 1.
- **description** is the full referring expression given by our annotators.
- **token** is the referring expression given by our annotators split up into words.
- **entities** is a list of pairings between substrings of the description and 3D locations. Each entity is made of two lists -- the first list enumerates all of the *tokens* which match that entity, and the second list enumerates all of the *3D instances* which match that entity. In ScanNet and ScanNet++, the 3D instances are formatted as `[object_id_in_underlying_scene_dataset]_[label_in_underlying_scene_dataset]`. In ARKitScenes, because our labels do not build on any underlying segmentation data, the 3D instances are just `[arbitrary_incrementing_object_index]_object`. The entities are used to ground specific *sub-phrases* of the overall description./
- **primary_key** is a UUID which uniquely identifies the annotation out of all annotations in all splits of the dataset.
- **scene_id** is the scene ID in the underlying scene dataset. The format varies depending on the underlying scene dataset.
- **scene_dataset** is the underlying scene dataset. It is always in `{ARKitScenes, ScanNet, ScanNet++}`
- **frames_used** is a field which *only* appears in the ScanNet++ splits. It contains the video frame indices shown to annotators at annotation time. We share this specifically for ScanNet++ because annotators were only shown segments of scenes to speed up annotation, whereas for ScanNet and ARKitScenes, entire scenes were annotated. It may be important because a referring expression may be uniquely-identifying within a "chunk" of a scene shown to annotators but not uniquely-identifying in the entire scene.
- **gt_boxes** is a field which *only* appears in the ARKitScenes split. It contains a (N x 3 x 2) list of 3D bounding boxes which correspond to the entities. This is necessary because we do not use any underlying instance segmentation data for our ARKitScenes data.

### How can I use the dataset?
Check out `dataset_playground.ipynb` for interactive visualization of any sample in the dataset. You'll need to supply your own copy of ARKitScenes/ScanNet/ScanNet++ and update the paths in the first cell.

Follow our instructions in `preprocessing/README` to download and prepare [ScanNet](http://www.scan-net.org/), [ScanNet++](https://kaldir.vc.in.tum.de/scannetpp/), [ARKitScenes](https://github.com/apple/ARKitScenes/blob/main/DATA.md) with the Locate 3D dataset.
